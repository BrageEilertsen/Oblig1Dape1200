    <h1>Report</h1>
    <p>As for a report of my first website I shall start by talking about some preparations I did in forehand to ensure universal accessibility. I did not really know this was really a thing before starting this project. My mindset was set to think that a website should only be understood by the people who see it, and not that the computer must understand it too. So, I did not really think about this as I was doing my preparation in this project. But as I was beginning to feel I was done doing the html and css, I used the AChecker to see if my coding was correct. Luckily for me it did not find any major mistakes or errors. Therefore, in did not need to make a second version of the website, as the assignment reads. On the other hand, it did find a lot of potential problems. For example, in the homepage it found 21 potential problems. These problems seemed so many and so small, and therefore I figured out these was not necessary to fix. When it comes to accessibility, I had to do some changes on the website when I looked at the example of poor accessibility. The change was that I figured out that a good webpage should be able to get navigated just by using the keyboard. So, to fix this problem I added small home links in all pages that did not already have it. To conclude I am happy the way the website came out, and have learned a lot, and especially about universal accessibility.</p>
